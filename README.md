## Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze data from 10 data science related channels. The project aims to find out what the most frequent topics creators talked about in 2023, through YouTube Data API.

## Data Collection:
The collected data are:
- Channel Name
- Video Title
- View Count
- Like Count
- Published Date
- Video Duration
- Number of Subscriber

## Conclusion:
In 2023, besides the essential skills such as Python and SQL are still the main focuses of the videos. However, we also observed that ChatGPT was a hot topic. In fact, ChatGPT is probably the most frequent word used in the title, based on word cloud analysis. Words such as "beginner", "project", and "career" imply that beginner-level education are still in need.
